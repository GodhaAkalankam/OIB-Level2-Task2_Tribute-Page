<h3 style="font-size:200%;">let's take a look at his journey</h3>
<h5><ul><li>Thagayya a form of Indian classical music.Tyagaraja and his contemporaries,Shyama Shastri and Muthuswami Dikshitar are regarded as the Trinity of Carnatic music.Thyagaraja composed thousands of devotional compositions,most in Telugu and in praise of Lord Rama,many of which remain popular today,the most popular being "Nagumomu".Of special mention are five of his compositions called the Pancharatna Kritis (transl. "five gems"),which are often sung in programs in his honour,and Utsava Sampradaya Krithis(Festive ritual compositions),which are often sung to accompany temple rituals.
</li>
<li>Tyagaraja lived through the reigns of four kings of the Maratha dynasty–Tulaja II(1763–1787),Amarasimha(1787–1798),Serfoji II(1798–1832) and Sivaji II(1832–1855),although he served none of them.</li>
<li>Like the great Telugu poet Potana, he spurned patronage and lived in penury.</li>
<li>Though born and brought up in present-day Tamil Nadu, he mastered the Telugu language and secured for it a preeminent place in the world of music through his wonderful compositions.</li>
<li>Couched in  a simple and lyrical style, they contain not only profound Vedantic truths, but also elementary rational precepts.</li>
<li>Ramabrahmam, and Seethamma were the parents of Thyagaraja and his two brothers.</li>
<li>Ramabrahmam was well versed in the Ramayana by virtue of which Thyagaraja became a devotee of Rama.</li>
<li>After gaining proficiency in Telugu and Sanskrit, he started to sing and play the Veena under a distinguished Asthana Vidwan in the Tanjore Court. </li>
<li>It is said that he chanted Rama Nama (name) 1,25,000 times everyday and completed 96 crores before he was thirty eight</li>
<li>Legend has it that the great sage Narada himself appeared before Thyagaraja and presented him a sacred treatise called Swararnava which is supposed to be the record of a dialogue between Shiva and Parvati on the glory and mysteries of music. </li>
<li>Thyagaraja spurned all temporal honours and rewards and lived only for worshiping Rama. </li>
</ul></h5>
